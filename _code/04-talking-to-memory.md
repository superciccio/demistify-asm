[Branches and loops]({{ '/code/03-branches-and-loops/' | relative_url }}) gave a
loop the power to repeat. But a loop that only churns registers runs out of things
to do — registers are few. The interesting work lives in **memory**, and you reach
it with just two instructions: one to read, one to write.

## Load and store

Registers and memory are separate worlds. The CPU computes on registers, but it
can only *move* data between them and memory — it never does arithmetic directly
on memory. Two instructions bridge the gap:

```text
lw  t1, 0(a0)        # LOAD word:  t1 = mem[a0 + 0]
sw  t1, 0(a0)        # STORE word: mem[a0 + 0] = t1
```

`lw` copies a word *out* of memory into a register; `sw` copies a register's value
*into* memory. (You met both briefly in [the stack]({{ '/code/02-the-stack/' | relative_url }})
— this is the lesson that owes you the full story.)

## Addresses and offsets

Memory is one giant numbered array of bytes, and an **address** is just an index
into it. The `0(a0)` syntax is an address built from two parts:

```text
lw  t1, 8(a0)        # address = a0 + 8
#       │  └─ base register: holds a starting address
#       └──── offset: a constant added to it
```

The base register holds where you are; the constant offset reaches a fixed
distance from there. This is exactly how the stack lesson read `12(sp)` — `sp` is
the base, `12` is the offset. The same pattern walks structs, arrays, and stack
frames alike.

## Bytes versus words

A word on RV32 is 4 bytes, so consecutive words sit **4 addresses apart**:
`mem[0]`, `mem[4]`, `mem[8]`, …. When you don't need a whole word, narrower
loads and stores reach a single byte:

```text
lb  t1, 0(a0)        # load byte, sign-extended  (e.g. for signed chars)
lbu t1, 0(a0)        # load byte, zero-extended  (e.g. for raw bytes / ASCII)
sb  t1, 0(a0)        # store the low byte of t1
```

`lb` fills the upper bits with the byte's sign so `-1` stays `-1`; `lbu` fills them
with zeros, which is what you want for text and unsigned data. Picking the wrong
one is a classic source of "why is my character a huge negative number?" bugs.

## Walking an array

Put load and loop together and you can sweep an entire array. Keep a **pointer**
in a register, read through it, then *advance the pointer* by one element each
time around — exactly the loop shape from the previous lesson, now with memory:

```text
        addi t0, zero, 0     # sum = 0
loop:   lw   t1, 0(a0)       # read the element a0 points at
        add  t0, t0, t1      # accumulate
        addi a0, a0, 4       # march the pointer to the next word
        addi t2, t2, -1      # count down the remaining elements
        bne  t2, zero, loop  # go again until none are left
```

Notice the offset never changes — it stays `0(a0)`. The pointer does the moving.
That's the heart of array traversal: a fixed access pattern over a marching base
address.

## Step through it

Use the visualizer and watch two panels at once. The **memory** panel shows the
array `[10, 32]` parked at `0x2000`. Press **step ▶** and follow `a0` in the
**registers** panel: each pass through the loop it climbs `0x2000 → 0x2004 →
0x2008`, while the very same `lw 0(a0)` pulls a different value each time. The sum
lands on `42` right as the counter hits zero and the branch falls through.

## Try this

- The array holds 4-byte words. What if you wrote `addi a0, a0, 1` instead of `4`?
  (You'd advance one *byte*, landing in the middle of the first word and reading
  garbage — element size and the stride must match.)
- How would you find the *largest* element instead of the sum? (Keep a "best so
  far" register; replace `add` with a `blt`/`bge` compare-and-update — same walk,
  different body.)
- Why must `lw` use a word-aligned address like `0x2004` and not `0x2003`? (Most
  loads expect natural alignment; a misaligned word access traps or runs slowly.)

Memory is where programs keep everything bigger than a handful of registers. With
loads, stores, and a marching pointer, you can now touch all of it — and that's
the foundation the [stack]({{ '/code/02-the-stack/' | relative_url }}) was quietly
standing on the whole time.
